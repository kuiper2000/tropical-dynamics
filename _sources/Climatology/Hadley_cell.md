# Week 4 and 5: Hadley Cell 
## Held-Hou Model

Follow the discussion in previous two weeks, this week, we will look at how energy is residtributed from tropics to other latitudes aka Hadley Cell. The early work on general circulation is motivated by the observation from Halley (1686) and Hadley (1735). They concluded that the tropical trade wind is part of large-scale ciruclation which redistributes the latitudinal difference in solar energy. Even without the upper-troposphere observation during that period, they also predicted the upper troposphere westerly, which is quite impressive. 

The zonal averaged Hadley circulation is shown in {numref}`FIG3-1` (mass stream function).

There are a few attampes to model the observed Hadley circulation.
