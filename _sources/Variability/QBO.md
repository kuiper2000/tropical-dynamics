# Week 9: Quasi-biennial Oscillation

Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a quasi-periodic oscillation in the stratospheric, zonal-mean zonal wind, characterized by a period of around 28 months. It was first discovered by Richard and Reed in 1960. The signal is so regular that one can observe it without implementing any filtering (see figure below)

The QBO can efficiently change the static stability around the tropopause, which has strong modulation on the convective activity. For example, during the easterly phase of QBO, the convection of MJO is much stronger than the westerly phase of QBO. Along with the MJO global impacts, one can expect that the fingerprint of QBO can be observed in most places around the globe. 

Given the QBO is high up in the stratosphere, the corresponding dynamics is relatively simple. A theory of QBO was first proposed by Lidzen and Holton (1968) and Holton and Lidzen (1972), which incorporates the well-known wave-mean flow interaction dynamics. According to their theory, the oscillation is due to the interaction of upward-propagating Kelvin and Yanai waves with the mean flow. More recently, it has been proposed that eastward and westward-propagating gravity waves play an important role and the low frequency waves were de-emphasized. 

The various equatorially trapped waves discovered by Matsuno (1966) (discussed {ref}`waves1`) are observed to produce wave energy which further propagates upward and downward. It is believed that the energy source comes from diabatic processes such as convection (Nitta 1972). While in {ref}`waves1`, a resting basic state is considered, it is very important to consider mean flow due to the _Doppler Shift_. 

Like other waves, the atmospheric waves also experience Doppler Shift as long as the relative motion happens between the observer and the source of waves. For example, the westward propagating wave looks more stationary when riding on a westerly mean flow (i.e., frequency $\sim \infty$) and the eastward propagating wave looks more transient (i.e., complete multiple oscillations in a short period). For example, the siren frequency from an ambulance sounds higher when it approaches the person listening to it and vice versa. When the observed wave number exceeds the wave number where the mean flow can maintain, wave breaks and deposits momentum.
