# Week 9: Quasi-biennial Oscillation

Quasi-biennial Oscillation (QBO) is a quasi-periodic oscillation in the stratospheric, zonal-mean zonal wind, characterized by a period of around 28 months. It was first discovered by Richard and Reed in 1960. The signal is so regular that one can observe it without implementing any filtering (see figure below)

The QBO can efficiently change the static stability around the tropopause, which has strong modulation on the convective activity. For example, during the easterly phase of QBO, the convection of MJO is much stronger than the westerly phase of QBO. Along with the MJO global impacts, one can expect that the fingerprint of QBO can be observed in most places around the globe. 

Given the QBO is high up in the stratosphere, the corresponding dynamics is relatively simple. A theory of QBO was first proposed by Lidzen and Holton (1968) and Holton and Lidzen (1972).
