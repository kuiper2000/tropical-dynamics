# Week 6 and 7: Tropical Wave Theory
## Shallow Water Model


In addition to zonal mean circulation, eddy also plays an important role in shaping tropical climatology. Here we repeat the same scale analysis in  {ref}`scale_analysis`.

\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + [u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+ v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}]-\beta yv & = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\\
\end{align}
