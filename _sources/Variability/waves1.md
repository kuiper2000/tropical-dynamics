# Week 6 and 7: Tropical Wave Theory
## Shallow Water Model

In addition to zonal mean circulation, eddy also plays an important role in shaping tropical climatology. Here we repeat the same scale analysis in  {ref}`scale_analysis`. 


```{math}
:label: shallow_water_1
\begin{align}
\frac{\partial u}{\partial t} + [u\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+ v\frac{\partial u}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial u}{\partial z}]-\beta yv & = -\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial x}\\

\frac{\partial v}{\partial t} + [u\frac{\partial v}{\partial x}+ v\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+w\frac{\partial v}{\partial z}]+ \beta yu & =-\frac{1}{\rho}\frac{\partial p}{\partial y} \\

\frac{\partial u}{\partial x}+\frac{\partial v}{\partial y}+\frac{\partial w}{\partial z} &=0 \\


\end{align}
