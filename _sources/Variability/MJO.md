# Week 8: Madden-Julian oscillation
## Weak Temperature and Steady State Response 


MJO is a unique feature existing in the tropical Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific, which characterized by planetary scale circulation (zonal wave number around $1-4$ and ) intraseasonal timescales (20-90 days of period). That's why it's also called _tropical intraseasonal variability_. Its signal is so strong that we can even observe it from the raw sounding data. Figure below shows the power spectrum of tropical sea-level pressure collecting at various sounding sites from {cite}`Madden1971-ao` paper. The local maximum around periods of 40-50 days shows the finger-print of MJO.

The MJO has pronounced global impacts. It modulates South/Southeast Asia summer monsoon variability and the associated extremes such as tropical cyclone and drought. Its interation with subtropical jet can creates quasi-stationary Rossby wave, where the wave energy propagates into the North America (so-called Pacific-North America pattern, PNA) and influences the winter storm activity as well as the polar vortex. Though the significant global influene from MJO, the communities struggled modeling its underlying dynamics since its first discovery. Two key variables are especially important (1) frequency (or period) and (2) shallo-to-deep vertical structure evolution. We will begin with our discussion at these two variables. 


## Wave Dynamics

From wave dynamics perspective, the MJO has long been considered as a type of convectively coupled wave
