(MJO)=
# Week 8: Madden-Julian oscillation
## Weak Temperature and Steady State Response 


MJO is a unique feature existing in the tropical Indian Ocean and the Western Pacific, which characterized by planetary scale circulation (zonal wave number around $1-4$ and ) intraseasonal timescales (20-90 days of period). That's why it's also called _tropical intraseasonal variability_. Its signal is so strong that we can observe it from the raw sounding data. Figure below shows the power spectrum of tropical sea-level pressure collecting at various sounding sites from \cite{Madden1971-ao} paper.
